                A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity
                stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling
                happier, more relaxed and less anxious. You may also feel better
                about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly,
                which can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.

                What motivates each of us to work out is different: maybe it's a
                health problem, an issue with sleep, a special event you want to
                look great for, having more energy to play with your kids or
                grandkids, or simply wanting to feel better and healthier in
                your own skin.
